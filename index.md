# WWT Web Examples

This site hosts examples of how to use the various Web toolkits provided by
the [AAS](https://aas.org/)
[WorldWide Telescope](http://www.worldwidetelescope.org), a free, open-source
tool for visually exploring humanity’s scientific understanding of the
Universe.

The examples are hosted on a separate, somewhat-funky domain because the core
WWT web services are currently not HTTPS-enabled, which means that any
examples that use the web services must be accessible via plain HTTP without
encryption. GitHub Pages forces you to use SSL unless you activate a custom
domain, so that’s what we’ve done. Rest assured that we are working on getting
HTTPS going to remove this limitation.

## Get Involved

Your contributions, especially additional examples, are more than welcome!
Please see the [WWT Contributors’ Guide] and [WWT Code of Conduct] for general
guidelines about project participation. Both of these documents, and more
information, may be found at the [WWT Contributor Hub].
